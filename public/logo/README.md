# Logo Folder

**Drag and drop your logo here** to display it across the site.

## Supported formats
- `logo.png` (recommended)
- `logo.svg`
- `logo.webp`

## Usage
Place your logo file in this folder. The app checks in this order:
1. **logo.png** — Primary (recommended)
2. **logo.svg** — Fallback if PNG not found
3. **logo.webp** — Fallback if SVG not found

The logo will automatically appear in:
- Sidebar (dashboard navigation)
- Footer (all pages)
- Landing page hero

If no logo file is present, the app will show the "Enhanced AI" text branding instead.
