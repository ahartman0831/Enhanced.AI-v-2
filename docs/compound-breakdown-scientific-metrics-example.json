  "bodybuilding_discussions": "Commonly discussed for rapid mass gains and strength; frequently mentioned in bulking phases.",
  "risks_and_side_effects": "Liver toxicity, estrogenic effects, water retention, lipid disruption, hypertension.",

  "monitoring_markers": ["ALT", "AST", "HDL", "LDL", "Estradiol", "Blood Pressure"],
