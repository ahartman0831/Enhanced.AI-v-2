The user has bloodwork history with the following marker trends. Analyze and provide educational insights. Use structured, evidence-substantiated details sourced from literature (Endocrine Society guidelines, PMC reviews, JCEM, AHA) where applicable.

COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS (must follow):
- Include at least 2 of these phrases: "educational purposes only", "not medical advice", "consult a physician", "individual variability", "professional oversight"
- MANDATE in patternNotes: "Individual variability high; consult physician for trends."
- Use ONLY observational framing: "literature suggests", "studies note", "commonly discussed", "may correlate with"
- NEVER use: "recommend", "suggest" (without "consult"), "will see", "will experience", "predict", "guarantee", dosage numbers with units, or direct protocol instructions
- For commonlyDiscussedSupports: "noted in literature patterns" only; NO direct benefits claims. No "take this"—just "Explore in Shop/Supplement Analyzer."
- Frame all insights as hypothetical and variable. Add enhanced angle when relevant: "In bodybuilding lit, patterns with compounds like X show..."

MARKER INSIGHTS SCHEMA — each object must include (expand for teaching depth):

- marker: string
- trend: "up"|"down"|"stable"
- markerCategory: "hormonal"|"metabolic"|"cv"|"liver"|"kidney"|"inflammation"|"blood"|"other" (for UI icons)
- laymanWhatItIs: 2-3 sentences. E.g., for Testosterone Total ↑: "The primary male androgen, produced mainly in testes, influencing muscle mass, strength, and libido. In bloodwork, it measures bound/unbound forms; supraphysiological levels (e.g., >1000 ng/dL) are patterns noted in endocrine lit for enhanced states."
- laymanWhyMonitor: Teach relevance. E.g., "Serial tracking observes hormonal patterns; lit suggests monitoring for balance amid androgen influences, where trends ↑ may correlate with gains but require CV/liver oversight."
- litContext: Deepen with sources. E.g., "Studies (e.g., JCEM reviews) note high T ↑ correlations with polycythemia (RBC spikes) or prostate patterns; variability high due to genetics/dosing." Add enhanced: "In bodybuilding lit, patterns with compounds like Trestolone show rapid T elevations."
- observationalRisk: Serious risk framing—observational only.
- referenceRangesTrends: "Typical lab ref: 300-1000 ng/dL natural; enhanced patterns often 1500+ per observational studies. Trend ↑ from [prior] to [latest] may correlate with stack synergies—individual variability high." Use placeholder [prior]/[latest] from history when available.
- stackInteractions: Observational. E.g., "Lit suggests androgens (e.g., Test/MENT) amplify T while potentially suppressing HDL; monitor alongside lipids."
- prosConsBullets: Object with positivePatterns (array) and riskPatterns (array). E.g., for HDL ↑ (low at 32): positivePatterns: ["May correlate with better CV clearance per AHA studies"], riskPatterns: ["Low levels (<40 mg/dL) discussed in androgen lit for inflammation risks"]
- commonlyDiscussedSupports: "Lit patterns note boron/zinc for T support; communities discuss DIM for E2 balance. Explore in Shop/Supplement Analyzer."
- deepDiveSnippet: Optional 1-2 sentence lit snippet for expandable "Deep Dive" (e.g., "Endocrine Society guidelines note serial T monitoring in TRT contexts.")
- appTieIn: "Analyze potential interactions in Supplement Analyzer" or "Explore TRT clinics in Shop for pro oversight."
- amazonProductHint: Product name (e.g., "Onnit Zinc", "milk thistle silymarin")
- shopCategoryHint: "Explore recovery tools in Shop" or "Explore liver support in Shop"

COVER ALL MARKERS: Include A/G Ratio when flagged (low: "Patterns suggest inflammation/liver issues in lit—consult pro"). Include E2, PSA for TRT discussions. E2: "May correlate with aromatization in lit."

OUTPUT JSON:
- trendSummary: string
- patternNotes: array (Quest/LetsGetChecked; "Discuss patterns in app community—observational only"; "Some links earn commissions—educational exploration only")
- markerInsights: array of objects with all fields above

Return ONLY valid JSON.
