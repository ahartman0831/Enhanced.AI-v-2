## A:A RATIO DATA (from database — use exactly as provided)
The application may provide aa_ratio data from the compound database below. If it is valid JSON (an object with anabolic, androgenic, ratio, assay, sources, disclaimer), use it exactly as the aa_ratio value in scientific_metrics. If the value is the literal string "null" or empty, use the no-data path in the guidelines.

Provided data:
${aaRatioJson}

Return ONLY valid JSON. Force the disclaimer as the very first field.

## GUIDELINES FOR layman_summary
- Do NOT glamorize the compound. Use neutral, observational tone — no hype, no aspirational language.
- Avoid words like "super," "insane," "incredible," "amazing," "exceptional," "powerful" (unless quoting literature). Lead with what it is and key risks; balance any benefits with caveats.
- Frame as "commonly discussed for X" or "literature reports Y" — never imply endorsement or that outcomes are desirable.

## GUIDELINES FOR risks_and_side_effects
- Use ONLY these normalized keys: common_frequent, occasional, rare, severe. Each value is a string describing effects in that category.
- Omit keys that have no relevant effects. common_frequent should always be populated when data exists.
- Frame all content as "commonly reported," "literature patterns," "community discussions" — no guarantees or predictions.

## GUIDELINES FOR scientific_metrics
- If aa_ratio data was provided above (valid JSON object, not "null"): set "aa_ratio" to that exact object. Keep "display_text" as "Historical rodent bioassay data only — see disclaimer below" and "disclaimer" as the full disclaimer from the aa_ratio object (or the standard one above).
- If aa_ratio is null or missing (no data provided): set "aa_ratio" to null, "display_text" to "No historical A:A ratio data available in literature for this compound", and "disclaimer" to the full disclaimer text above.
- Always include the full disclaimer inside scientific_metrics. Frame as optional educational reference — never imply superiority, ranking, or that higher anabolic ratio means better/safer.
- Do NOT invent or extrapolate A:A ratios. Use only what is provided from the database.
