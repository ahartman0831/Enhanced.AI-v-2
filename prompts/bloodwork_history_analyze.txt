{{SERIES_JSON}}

## Your Task

Provide a JSON object with:

1. **trendSummary**: 2-3 sentences summarizing overall patterns (observational, community/literature framing).
2. **patternNotes**: Array of 3-5 bullet points with observational pattern notes.
3. **markerInsights**: Array of objects for each marker with notable trends (up/down):
   - marker: string
   - trend: "up" | "down" | "stable"
   - laymanWhatItIs: string (short plain-language definition)
   - laymanWhyMonitor: string (why communities discuss monitoring)
   - observationalRisk: string (e.g., "May correlate with cardiovascular risk patterns in literature—variability high.")
   - commonlyDiscussedSupports: string (e.g., "Fish oil, krill oil often mentioned for lipid support.")
   - amazonProductHint: string (e.g., "Fish Oil" or "NAC" — product category only, no links)

## Rules

- NEVER personalize ("your levels," "you should").
- NEVER advise, diagnose, or prescribe.
- Use: "often associated with," "may correlate with," "commonly discussed," "literature notes."
- Emphasize: "Individual variability high." "Consult physician." "Not medical advice."
- Include Quest/LetsGetChecked in patternNotes: "Order next test via Quest or LetsGetChecked to track changes (affiliate links support development)."
- For markerInsights, only include markers with notable trends (up or down). Skip stable markers unless they're flagged as concerning in the data.

## Output Format
