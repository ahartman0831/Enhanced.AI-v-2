{{SERIES_JSON}}

## Your Task

Provide 2-4 short bullet points of observational pattern notes. Use ONLY community/literature framing:

- "Trends in [marker] are often discussed in optimization forums for [context]."
- "Rising/falling [marker] may correlate with patterns noted in literature—individual variability high."
- "Communities commonly track [marker] for [reason]; physician oversight emphasized."
- "Literature notes that [pattern]—forums stress repeat testing and professional review."

## Rules

- NEVER personalize ("your levels," "you should").
- NEVER advise, diagnose, or prescribe.
- Use: "often associated with," "may correlate with," "commonly discussed," "literature notes."
- Emphasize: "Individual variability high." "Consult physician." "Not medical advice."
- Keep each bullet to 1-2 sentences.
- Include a closing line: "Order next test via Quest or LetsGetChecked to track changes (affiliate links support development)."

## Output Format

Return a JSON object:
{
  "patternNotes": ["bullet 1", "bullet 2", "bullet 3"]
}
